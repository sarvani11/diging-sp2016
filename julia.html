										<h2 class="major">Julia Damerow, PhD</h2>
										<p>Julia Damerow is a software engineer and saxaphonist working at Arizona State University. She grew up in a suburb of Berlin, in Germany, with her sister Sophie. After getting her Diplom in computer science, Professor Laubichler talked her into coming to Tempe to study computational history and philosophy of science. She was the brains behind almost all of the computational HPS research infrastructure in the Center for Biology and Society, and together with Erick Peirson started the Digital Innovation Group in 2012. She and Erick also founded a company called A Place Called Up Consulting, so that they could provide support to academics and others who are interested in digital humanities.</p>
										<p>In her free time, Julia hangs out with her two cats Walkie Talkie and Tango. Sometimes she plays the saxaphone in a local ska band. Julia's ideal environment is a city with lots of fun things to do and, although she grew up in a place known for cold winters, Julia does seem to prefer staying warm. Probably her favorite book in the world is Douglas Adam's <em>A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em>.</p>
